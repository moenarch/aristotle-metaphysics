## Part 9

That the actuality is also better and more valuable than the good potency is evident from the following argument.
Everything of which we say that it can do something, is alike capable of contraries, e.g.
that of which we say that it can be well is the same as that which can be ill, and has both potencies at once; for the same potency is a potency of health and illness, of rest and motion, of building and throwing down, of being built and being thrown down.
The capacity for contraries, then, is present at the same time; but contraries cannot be present at the same time, and the actualities also cannot be present at the same time, e.g.
health and illness.
Therefore, while the good must be one of them, the capacity is both alike, or neither; the actuality, then, is better.
Also in the case of bad things the end or actuality must be worse than the potency; for that which 'can' is both contraries alike.
Clearly, then, the bad does not exist apart from bad things; for the bad is in its nature posterior to the potency.
And therefore we may also say that in the things which are from the beginning, i.e.
in eternal things, there is nothing bad, nothing defective, nothing perverted (for perversion is something bad).

It is an activity also that geometrical constructions are discovered; for we find them by dividing.
If the figures had been already divided, the constructions would have been obvious; but as it is they are present only potentially.
Why are the angles of the triangle equal to two right angles?
Because the angles about one point are equal to two right angles.
If, then, the line parallel to the side had been already drawn upwards, the reason would have been evident to any one as soon as he saw the figure.
Why is the angle in a semicircle in all cases a right angle?
If three lines are equal the two which form the base, and the perpendicular from the centre-the conclusion is evident at a glance to one who knows the former proposition.
Obviously, therefore, the potentially existing constructions are discovered by being brought to actuality; the reason is that the geometer's thinking is an actuality; so that the potency proceeds from an actuality; and therefore it is by making constructions that people come to know them (though the single actuality is later in generation than the corresponding potency).
