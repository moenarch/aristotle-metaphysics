## Part 5

Since some things are and are not, without coming to be and ceasing to be, e.g.
points, if they can be said to be, and in general forms (for it is not 'white' comes to be, but the wood comes to be white, if everything that comes to be comes from something and comes to be something), not all contraries can come from one another, but it is in different senses that a pale man comes from a dark man, and pale comes from dark.
Nor has everything matter, but only those things which come to be and change into one another.
Those things which, without ever being in course of changing, are or are not, have no matter.

There is difficulty in the question how the matter of each thing is related to its contrary states.
E.g.
if the body is potentially healthy, and disease is contrary to health, is it potentially both healthy and diseased?
And is water potentially wine and vinegar?
We answer that it is the matter of one in virtue of its positive state and its form, and of the other in virtue of the privation of its positive state and the corruption of it contrary to its nature.
It is also hard to say why wine is not said to be the matter of vinegar nor potentially vinegar (though vinegar is produced from it), and why a living man is not said to be potentially dead.
In fact they are not, but the corruptions in question are accidental, and it is the matter of the animal that is itself in virtue of its corruption the potency and matter of a corpse, and it is water that is the matter of vinegar.
For the corpse comes from the animal, and vinegar from wine, as night from day.
And all the things which change thus into one another must go back to their matter; e.g.
if from a corpse is produced an animal, the corpse first goes back to its matter, and only then becomes an animal; and vinegar first goes back to water, and only then becomes wine.
