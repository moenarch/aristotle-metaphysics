## Part 5

Above all one might discuss the question what in the world the Forms contribute to sensible things, either to those that are eternal or to those that come into being and cease to be; for they cause neither movement nor any change in them.
But again they help in no wise either towards the knowledge of other things (for they are not even the substance of these, else they would have been in them), or towards their being, if they are not in the individuals which share in them; though if they were, they might be thought to be causes, as white causes whiteness in a white object by entering into its composition.
But this argument, which was used first by Anaxagoras, and later by Eudoxus in his discussion of difficulties and by certain others, is very easily upset; for it is easy to collect many and insuperable objections to such a view.

But, further, all other things cannot come from the Forms in any of the usual senses of 'from'.
And to say that they are patterns and the other things share in them is to use empty words and poetical metaphors.
For what is it that works, looking to the Ideas?
And any thing can both be and come into being without being copied from something else, so that, whether Socrates exists or not, a man like Socrates might come to be.
And evidently this might be so even if Socrates were eternal.
And there will be several patterns of the same thing, and therefore several Forms; e.g.
'animal' and 'two-footed', and also 'man-himself', will be Forms of man.
Again, the Forms are patterns not only of sensible things, but of Forms themselves also; i.e.
the genus is the pattern of the various forms-of-a-genus; therefore the same thing will be pattern and copy.

Again, it would seem impossible that substance and that whose substance it is should exist apart; how, therefore, could the Ideas, being the substances of things, exist apart?

In the Phaedo the case is stated in this way-that the Forms are causes both of being and of becoming.
Yet though the Forms exist, still things do not come into being, unless there is something to originate movement; and many other things come into being (e.g.
a house or a ring) of which they say there are no Forms.
Clearly therefore even the things of which they say there are Ideas can both be and come into being owing to such causes as produce the things just mentioned, and not owing to the Forms.
But regarding the Ideas it is possible, both in this way and by more abstract and accurate arguments, to collect many objections like those we have considered.
