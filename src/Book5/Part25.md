## Part 25

'Part' means (1, a) that into which a quantum can in any way be divided; for that which is taken from a quantum qua quantum is always called a part of it, e.g.
two is called in a sense a part of three.
It means (b), of the parts in the first sense, only those which measure the whole; this is why two, though in one sense it is, in another is not, called a part of three.-(2) The elements into which a kind might be divided apart from the quantity are also called parts of it; for which reason we say the species are parts of the genus.-(3) The elements into which a whole is divided, or of which it consists-the 'whole' meaning either the form or that which has the form; e.g.
of the bronze sphere or of the bronze cube both the bronze-i.e.
the matter in which the form is-and the characteristic angle are parts.-(4) The elements in the definition which explains a thing are also parts of the whole; this is why the genus is called a part of the species, though in another sense the species is part of the genus.
