## Part 20

'Having' means (1) a kind of activity of the haver and of what he has-something like an action or movement.
For when one thing makes and one is made, between them there is a making; so too between him who has a garment and the garment which he has there is a having.
This sort of having, then, evidently we cannot have; for the process will go on to infinity, if it is to be possible to have the having of what we have.-(2) 'Having' or 'habit' means a disposition according to which that which is disposed is either well or ill disposed, and either in itself or with reference to something else; e.g.
health is a 'habit'; for it is such a disposition.-(3) We speak of a 'habit' if there is a portion of such a disposition; and so even the excellence of the parts is a 'habit' of the whole thing.
