## Part 30

'Accident' means (1) that which attaches to something and can be truly asserted, but neither of necessity nor usually, e.g.
if some one in digging a hole for a plant has found treasure.
This-the finding of treasure-is for the man who dug the hole an accident; for neither does the one come of necessity from the other or after the other, nor, if a man plants, does he usually find treasure.
And a musical man might be pale; but since this does not happen of necessity nor usually, we call it an accident.
Therefore since there are attributes and they attach to subjects, and some of them attach to these only in a particular place and at a particular time, whatever attaches to a subject, but not because it was this subject, or the time this time, or the place this place, will be an accident.
Therefore, too, there is no definite cause for an accident, but a chance cause, i.e.
an indefinite one.
Going to Aegina was an accident for a man, if he went not in order to get there, but because he was carried out of his way by a storm or captured by pirates.
The accident has happened or exists,-not in virtue of the subject's nature, however, but of something else; for the storm was the cause of his coming to a place for which he was not sailing, and this was Aegina.

'Accident' has also (2) another meaning, i.e.
all that attaches to each thing in virtue of itself but is not in its essence, as having its angles equal to two right angles attaches to the triangle.
And accidents of this sort may be eternal, but no accident of the other sort is.
This is explained elsewhere.
