## Part 18

'That in virtue of which' has several meanings:-(1) the form or substance of each thing, e.g.
that in virtue of which a man is good is the good itself, (2) the proximate subject in which it is the nature of an attribute to be found, e.g.
colour in a surface.
'That in virtue of which', then, in the primary sense is the form, and in a secondary sense the matter of each thing and the proximate substratum of each.-In general 'that in virtue of which' will found in the same number of senses as 'cause'; for we say indifferently (3) in virtue of what has he come?'
or 'for what end has he come?
'; and (4) in virtue of what has he inferred wrongly, or inferred?'
or 'what is the cause of the inference, or of the wrong inference?
'-Further (5) Kath' d is used in reference to position, e.g.
'at which he stands' or 'along which he walks; for all such phrases indicate place and position.

Therefore 'in virtue of itself' must likewise have several meanings.
The following belong to a thing in virtue of itself:-(1) the essence of each thing, e.g.
Callias is in virtue of himself Callias and what it was to be Callias;-(2) whatever is present in the 'what', e.g.
Callias is in virtue of himself an animal.
For 'animal' is present in his definition; Callias is a particular animal.-(3) Whatever attribute a thing receives in itself directly or in one of its parts; e.g.
a surface is white in virtue of itself, and a man is alive in virtue of himself; for the soul, in which life directly resides, is a part of the man.-(4) That which has no cause other than itself; man has more than one cause--animal, two-footed--but yet man is man in virtue of himself.-(5) Whatever attributes belong to a thing alone, and in so far as they belong to it merely by virtue of itself considered apart by itself.
