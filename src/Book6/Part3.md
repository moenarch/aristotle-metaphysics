## Part 3

That there are principles and causes which are generable and destructible without ever being in course of being generated or destroyed, is obvious.
For otherwise all things will be of necessity, since that which is being generated or destroyed must have a cause which is not accidentally its cause.
Will A exist or not?
It will if B happens; and if not, not.
And B will exist if C happens.
And thus if time is constantly subtracted from a limited extent of time, one will obviously come to the present.
This man, then, will die by violence, if he goes out; and he will do this if he gets thirsty; and he will get thirsty if something else happens; and thus we shall come to that which is now present, or to some past event.
For instance, he will go out if he gets thirsty; and he will get thirsty if he is eating pungent food; and this is either the case or not; so that he will of necessity die, or of necessity not die.
And similarly if one jumps over to past events, the same account will hold good; for this-I mean the past condition-is already present in something.
Everything, therefore, that will be, will be of necessity; e.g.
it is necessary that he who lives shall one day die; for already some condition has come into existence, e.g.
the presence of contraries in the same body.
But whether he is to die by disease or by violence is not yet determined, but depends on the happening of something else.
Clearly then the process goes back to a certain starting-point, but this no longer points to something further.
This then will be the starting-point for the fortuitous, and will have nothing else as cause of its coming to be.
But to what sort of starting-point and what sort of cause we thus refer the fortuitous-whether to matter or to the purpose or to the motive power, must be carefully considered.
