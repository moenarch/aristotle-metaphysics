## Part 9

One might raise the question, why woman does not differ from man in species, when female and male are contrary and their difference is a contrariety; and why a female and a male animal are not different in species, though this difference belongs to animal in virtue of its own nature, and not as paleness or darkness does; both 'female' and 'male' belong to it qua animal.
This question is almost the same as the other, why one contrariety makes things different in species and another does not, e.g.
'with feet' and 'with wings' do, but paleness and darkness do not.
Perhaps it is because the former are modifications peculiar to the genus, and the latter are less so.
And since one element is definition and one is matter, contrarieties which are in the definition make a difference in species, but those which are in the thing taken as including its matter do not make one.
And so paleness in a man, or darkness, does not make one, nor is there a difference in species between the pale man and the dark man, not even if each of them be denoted by one word.
For man is here being considered on his material side, and matter does not create a difference; for it does not make individual men species of man, though the flesh and the bones of which this man and that man consist are other.
The concrete thing is other, but not other in species, because in the definition there is no contrariety.
This is the ultimate indivisible kind.
Callias is definition + matter, the pale man, then, is so also, because it is the individual Callias that is pale; man, then, is pale only incidentally.
Neither do a brazen and a wooden circle, then, differ in species; and if a brazen triangle and a wooden circle differ in species, it is not because of the matter, but because there is a contrariety in the definition.
But does the matter not make things other in species, when it is other in a certain way, or is there a sense in which it does?
For why is this horse other than this man in species, although their matter is included with their definitions?
Doubtless because there is a contrariety in the definition.
For while there is a contrariety also between pale man and dark horse, and it is a contrariety in species, it does not depend on the paleness of the one and the darkness of the other, since even if both had been pale, yet they would have been other in species.
But male and female, while they are modifications peculiar to 'animal', are so not in virtue of its essence but in the matter, ie.
the body.
This is why the same seed becomes female or male by being acted on in a certain way.
We have stated, then, what it is to be other in species, and why some things differ in species and others do not.
