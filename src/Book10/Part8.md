## Part 8

That which is other in species is other than something in something, and this must belong to both; e.g.
if it is an animal other in species, both are animals.
The things, then, which are other in species must be in the same genus.
For by genus I mean that one identical thing which is predicated of both and is differentiated in no merely accidental way, whether conceived as matter or otherwise.
For not only must the common nature attach to the different things, e.g.
not only must both be animals, but this very animality must also be different for each (e.g.
in the one case equinity, in the other humanity), and so this common nature is specifically different for each from what it is for the other.
One, then, will be in virtue of its own nature one sort of animal, and the other another, e.g.
one a horse and the other a man.
This difference, then, must be an otherness of the genus.
For I give the name of 'difference in the genus' an otherness which makes the genus itself other.

This, then, will be a contrariety (as can be shown also by induction).
For all things are divided by opposites, and it has been proved that contraries are in the same genus.
For contrariety was seen to be complete difference; and all difference in species is a difference from something in something; so that this is the same for both and is their genus.
(Hence also all contraries which are different in species and not in genus are in the same line of predication, and other than one another in the highest degree-for the difference is complete-, and cannot be present along with one another.)
The difference, then, is a contrariety.

This, then, is what it is to be 'other in species'-to have a contrariety, being in the same genus and being indivisible (and those things are the same in species which have no contrariety, being indivisible); we say 'being indivisible', for in the process of division contrarieties arise in the intermediate stages before we come to the indivisibles.
Evidently, therefore, with reference to that which is called the genus, none of the species-of-a-genus is either the same as it or other than it in species (and this is fitting; for the matter is indicated by negation, and the genus is the matter of that of which it is called the genus, not in the sense in which we speak of the genus or family of the Heraclidae, but in that in which the genus is an element in a thing's nature), nor is it so with reference to things which are not in the same genus, but it will differ in genus from them, and in species from things in the same genus.
For a thing's difference from that from which it differs in species must be a contrariety; and this belongs only to things in the same genus.
