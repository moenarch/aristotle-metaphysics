## Part 3

Note, next, that neither the matter nor the form comes to be-and I mean the last matter and form.
For everything that changes is something and is changed by something and into something.
That by which it is changed is the immediate mover; that which is changed, the matter; that into which it is changed, the form.
The process, then, will go on to infinity, if not only the bronze comes to be round but also the round or the bronze comes to be; therefore there must be a stop.

Note, next, that each substance comes into being out of something that shares its name.
(Natural objects and other things both rank as substances.)
For things come into being either by art or by nature or by luck or by spontaneity.
Now art is a principle of movement in something other than the thing moved, nature is a principle in the thing itself (for man begets man), and the other causes are privations of these two.

There are three kinds of substance-the matter, which is a 'this' in appearance (for all things that are characterized by contact and not, by organic unity are matter and substratum, e.g.
fire, flesh, head; for these are all matter, and the last matter is the matter of that which is in the full sense substance); the nature, which is a 'this' or positive state towards which movement takes place; and again, thirdly, the particular substance which is composed of these two, e.g.
Socrates or Callias.
Now in some cases the 'this' does not exist apart from the composite substance, e.g.
the form of house does not so exist, unless the art of building exists apart (nor is there generation and destruction of these forms, but it is in another way that the house apart from its matter, and health, and all ideals of art, exist and do not exist); but if the 'this' exists apart from the concrete thing, it is only in the case of natural objects.
And so Plato was not far wrong when he said that there are as many Forms as there are kinds of natural object (if there are Forms distinct from the things of this earth).
The moving causes exist as things preceding the effects, but causes in the sense of definitions are simultaneous with their effects.
For when a man is healthy, then health also exists; and the shape of a bronze sphere exists at the same time as the bronze sphere.
(But we must examine whether any form also survives afterwards.
For in some cases there is nothing to prevent this; e.g.
the soul may be of this sort-not all soul but the reason; for presumably it is impossible that all soul should survive.)
Evidently then there is no necessity, on this ground at least, for the existence of the Ideas.
For man is begotten by man, a given man by an individual father; and similarly in the arts; for the medical art is the formal cause of health.
