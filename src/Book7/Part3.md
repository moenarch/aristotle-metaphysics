## Part 3

The word 'substance' is applied, if not in more senses, still at least to four main objects; for both the essence and the universal and the genus, are thought to be the substance of each thing, and fourthly the substratum.
Now the substratum is that of which everything else is predicated, while it is itself not predicated of anything else.
And so we must first determine the nature of this; for that which underlies a thing primarily is thought to be in the truest sense its substance.
And in one sense matter is said to be of the nature of substratum, in another, shape, and in a third, the compound of these.
(By the matter I mean, for instance, the bronze, by the shape the pattern of its form, and by the compound of these the statue, the concrete whole.)
Therefore if the form is prior to the matter and more real, it will be prior also to the compound of both, for the same reason.

We have now outlined the nature of substance, showing that it is that which is not predicated of a stratum, but of which all else is predicated.
But we must not merely state the matter thus; for this is not enough.
The statement itself is obscure, and further, on this view, matter becomes substance.
For if this is not substance, it baffles us to say what else is.
When all else is stripped off evidently nothing but matter remains.
For while the rest are affections, products, and potencies of bodies, length, breadth, and depth are quantities and not substances (for a quantity is not a substance), but the substance is rather that to which these belong primarily.
But when length and breadth and depth are taken away we see nothing left unless there is something that is bounded by these; so that to those who consider the question thus matter alone must seem to be substance.
By matter I mean that which in itself is neither a particular thing nor of a certain quantity nor assigned to any other of the categories by which being is determined.
For there is something of which each of these is predicated, whose being is different from that of each of the predicates (for the predicates other than substance are predicated of substance, while substance is predicated of matter).
Therefore the ultimate substratum is of itself neither a particular thing nor of a particular quantity nor otherwise positively characterized; nor yet is it the negations of these, for negations also will belong to it only by accident.

If we adopt this point of view, then, it follows that matter is substance.
But this is impossible; for both separability and 'thisness' are thought to belong chiefly to substance.
And so form and the compound of form and matter would be thought to be substance, rather than matter.
The substance compounded of both, i.e.
of matter and shape, may be dismissed; for it is posterior and its nature is obvious.
And matter also is in a sense manifest.
But we must inquire into the third kind of substance; for this is the most perplexing.

Some of the sensible substances are generally admitted to be substances, so that we must look first among these.
For it is an advantage to advance to that which is more knowable.
For learning proceeds for all in this way-through that which is less knowable by nature to that which is more knowable; and just as in conduct our task is to start from what is good for each and make what is without qualification good good for each, so it is our task to start from what is more knowable to oneself and make what is knowable by nature knowable to oneself.
Now what is knowable and primary for particular sets of people is often knowable to a very small extent, and has little or nothing of reality.
But yet one must start from that which is barely knowable but knowable to oneself, and try to know what is knowable without qualification, passing, as has been said, by way of those very things which one does know.
