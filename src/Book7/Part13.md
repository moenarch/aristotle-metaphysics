## Part 13

Let us return to the subject of our inquiry, which is substance.
As the substratum and the essence and the compound of these are called substance, so also is the universal.
About two of these we have spoken; both about the essence and about the substratum, of which we have said that it underlies in two senses, either being a 'this'-which is the way in which an animal underlies its attributes-or as the matter underlies the complete reality.
The universal also is thought by some to be in the fullest sense a cause, and a principle; therefore let us attack the discussion of this point also.
For it seems impossible that any universal term should be the name of a substance.
For firstly the substance of each thing is that which is peculiar to it, which does not belong to anything else; but the universal is common, since that is called universal which is such as to belong to more than one thing.
Of which individual then will this be the substance?
Either of all or of none; but it cannot be the substance of all.
And if it is to be the substance of one, this one will be the others also; for things whose substance is one and whose essence is one are themselves also one.

Further, substance means that which is not predicable of a subject, but the universal is predicable of some subject always.

But perhaps the universal, while it cannot be substance in the way in which the essence is so, can be present in this; e.g.
'animal' can be present in 'man' and 'horse'.
Then clearly it is a formula of the essence.
And it makes no difference even if it is not a formula of everything that is in the substance; for none the less the universal will be the substance of something, as 'man' is the substance of the individual man in whom it is present, so that the same result will follow once more; for the universal, e.g.
'animal', will be the substance of that in which it is present as something peculiar to it.
And further it is impossible and absurd that the 'this', i.e.
the substance, if it consists of parts, should not consist of substances nor of what is a 'this', but of quality; for that which is not substance, i.e.
the quality, will then be prior to substance and to the 'this'.
Which is impossible; for neither in formula nor in time nor in coming to be can the modifications be prior to the substance; for then they will also be separable from it.
Further, Socrates will contain a substance present in a substance, so that this will be the substance of two things.
And in general it follows, if man and such things are substance, that none of the elements in their formulae is the substance of anything, nor does it exist apart from the species or in anything else; I mean, for instance, that no 'animal' exists apart from the particular kinds of animal, nor does any other of the elements present in formulae exist apart.

If, then, we view the matter from these standpoints, it is plain that no universal attribute is a substance, and this is plain also from the fact that no common predicate indicates a 'this', but rather a 'such'.
If not, many difficulties follow and especially the 'third man'.

The conclusion is evident also from the following consideration.
A substance cannot consist of substances present in it in complete reality; for things that are thus in complete reality two are never in complete reality one, though if they are potentially two, they can be one (e.g.
the double line consists of two halves-potentially; for the complete realization of the halves divides them from one another); therefore if the substance is one, it will not consist of substances present in it and present in this way, which Democritus describes rightly; he says one thing cannot be made out of two nor two out of one; for he identifies substances with his indivisible magnitudes.
It is clear therefore that the same will hold good of number, if number is a synthesis of units, as is said by some; for two is either not one, or there is no unit present in it in complete reality.
But our result involves a difficulty.
If no substance can consist of universals because a universal indicates a 'such', not a 'this', and if no substance can be composed of substances existing in complete reality, every substance would be incomposite, so that there would not even be a formula of any substance.
But it is thought by all and was stated long ago that it is either only, or primarily, substance that can defined; yet now it seems that not even substance can.
There cannot, then, be a definition of anything; or in a sense there can be, and in a sense there cannot.
And what we are saying will be plainer from what follows.
