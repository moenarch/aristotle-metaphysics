<p>From the same opinion proceeds the doctrine of Protagoras, and both doctrines must be alike true or alike untrue.
For on the one hand, if all opinions and appearances are true, all statements must be at the same time true and false.
For many men hold beliefs in which they conflict with one another, and think those mistaken who have not the same opinions as themselves; so that the same thing must both be and not be.
And on the other hand, if this is so, all opinions must be true; for those who are mistaken and those who are right are opposed to one another in their opinions; if, then, reality is such as the view in question supposes, all will be right in their beliefs.</p>
<p>Evidently, then, both doctrines proceed from the same way of thinking.
But the same method of discussion must not be used with all opponents; for some need persuasion, and others compulsion.
Those who have been driven to this position by difficulties in their thinking can easily be cured of their ignorance; for it is not their expressed argument but their thought that one has to meet.
But those who argue for the sake of argument can be cured only by refuting the argument as expressed in speech and in words.</p>
<p>Those who really feel the difficulties have been led to this opinion by observation of the sensible world.
(1) They think that contradictories or contraries are true at the same time, because they see contraries coming into existence out of the same thing.
If, then, that which is not cannot come to be, the thing must have existed before as both contraries alike, as Anaxagoras says all is mixed in all, and Democritus too; for he says the void and the full exist alike in every part, and yet one of these is being, and the other non-being.
To those, then, whose belief rests on these grounds, we shall say that in a sense they speak rightly and in a sense they err.
For 'that which is' has two meanings, so that in some sense a thing can come to be out of that which is not, while in some sense it cannot, and the same thing can at the same time be in being and not in being-but not in the same respect.
For the same thing can be potentially at the same time two contraries, but it cannot actually.
And again we shall ask them to believe that among existing things there is also another kind of substance to which neither movement nor destruction nor generation at all belongs.</p>
<p>And (2) similarly some have inferred from observation of the sensible world the truth of appearances.
For they think that the truth should not be determined by the large or small number of those who hold a belief, and that the same thing is thought sweet by some when they taste it, and bitter by others, so that if all were ill or all were mad, and only two or three were well or sane, these would be thought ill and mad, and not the others.</p>
<p>And again, they say that many of the other animals receive impressions contrary to ours; and that even to the senses of each individual, things do not always seem the same.
Which, then, of these impressions are true and which are false is not obvious; for the one set is no more true than the other, but both are alike.
And this is why Democritus, at any rate, says that either there is no truth or to us at least it is not evident.</p>
<p>And in general it is because these thinkers suppose knowledge to be sensation, and this to be a physical alteration, that they say that what appears to our senses must be true; for it is for these reasons that both Empedocles and Democritus and, one may almost say, all the others have fallen victims to opinions of this sort.
For Empedocles says that when men change their condition they change their knowledge; &quot;</p>
<p>For wisdom increases in men according to what is before them. &quot;</p>
<p>And elsewhere he says that:- &quot;</p>
<p>So far as their nature changed, so far to them always</p>
<p>Came changed thoughts into mind. &quot;</p>
<p>And Parmenides also expresses himself in the same way: &quot;</p>
<p>For as at each time the much-bent limbs are composed,</p>
<p>So is the mind of men; for in each and all men</p>
<p>'Tis one thing thinks-the substance of their limbs:</p>
<p>For that of which there is more is thought. &quot;</p>
<p>A saying of Anaxagoras to some of his friends is also related,-that things would be for them such as they supposed them to be.
And they say that Homer also evidently had this opinion, because he made Hector, when he was unconscious from the blow, lie 'thinking other thoughts',-which implies that even those who are bereft of thought have thoughts, though not the same thoughts.
Evidently, then, if both are forms of knowledge, the real things also are at the same time 'both so and not so'.
And it is in this direction that the consequences are most difficult.
For if those who have seen most of such truth as is possible for us (and these are those who seek and love it most)-if these have such opinions and express these views about the truth, is it not natural that beginners in philosophy should lose heart?
For to seek the truth would be to follow flying game.</p>
<p>But the reason why these thinkers held this opinion is that while they were inquiring into the truth of that which is, they thought, 'that which is' was identical with the sensible world; in this, however, there is largely present the nature of the indeterminate-of that which exists in the peculiar sense which we have explained; and therefore, while they speak plausibly, they do not say what is true (for it is fitting to put the matter so rather than as Epicharmus put it against Xenophanes).
And again, because they saw that all this world of nature is in movement and that about that which changes no true statement can be made, they said that of course, regarding that which everywhere in every respect is changing, nothing could truly be affirmed.
It was this belief that blossomed into the most extreme of the views above mentioned, that of the professed Heracliteans, such as was held by Cratylus, who finally did not think it right to say anything but only moved his finger, and criticized Heraclitus for saying that it is impossible to step twice into the same river; for he thought one could not do it even once.</p>
<p>But we shall say in answer to this argument also that while there is some justification for their thinking that the changing, when it is changing, does not exist, yet it is after all disputable; for that which is losing a quality has something of that which is being lost, and of that which is coming to be, something must already be.
And in general if a thing is perishing, will be present something that exists; and if a thing is coming to be, there must be something from which it comes to be and something by which it is generated, and this process cannot go on ad infinitum.-But, leaving these arguments, let us insist on this, that it is not the same thing to change in quantity and in quality.
Grant that in quantity a thing is not constant; still it is in respect of its form that we know each thing.-And again, it would be fair to criticize those who hold this view for asserting about the whole material universe what they saw only in a minority even of sensible things.
For only that region of the sensible world which immediately surrounds us is always in process of destruction and generation; but this is-so to speak-not even a fraction of the whole, so that it would have been juster to acquit this part of the world because of the other part, than to condemn the other because of this.-And again, obviously we shall make to them also the same reply that we made long ago; we must show them and persuade them that there is something whose nature is changeless.
Indeed, those who say that things at the same time are and are not, should in consequence say that all things are at rest rather than that they are in movement; for there is nothing into which they can change, since all attributes belong already to all subjects.</p>
<p>Regarding the nature of truth, we must maintain that not everything which appears is true; firstly, because even if sensation-at least of the object peculiar to the sense in question-is not false, still appearance is not the same as sensation.-Again, it is fair to express surprise at our opponents' raising the question whether magnitudes are as great, and colours are of such a nature, as they appear to people at a distance, or as they appear to those close at hand, and whether they are such as they appear to the healthy or to the sick, and whether those things are heavy which appear so to the weak or those which appear so to the strong, and those things true which appear to the slee ing or to the waking.
For obviously they do not think these to be open questions; no one, at least, if when he is in Libya he has fancied one night that he is in Athens, starts for the concert hall.-And again with regard to the future, as Plato says, surely the opinion of the physician and that of the ignorant man are not equally weighty, for instance, on the question whether a man will get well or not.-And again, among sensations themselves the sensation of a foreign object and that of the appropriate object, or that of a kindred object and that of the object of the sense in question, are not equally authoritative, but in the case of colour sight, not taste, has the authority, and in the case of flavour taste, not sight; each of which senses never says at the same time of the same object that it simultaneously is 'so and not so'.-But not even at different times does one sense disagree about the quality, but only about that to which the quality belongs.
I mean, for instance, that the same wine might seem, if either it or one's body changed, at one time sweet and at another time not sweet; but at least the sweet, such as it is when it exists, has never yet changed, but one is always right about it, and that which is to be sweet is of necessity of such and such a nature.
Yet all these views destroy this necessity, leaving nothing to be of necessity, as they leave no essence of anything; for the necessary cannot be in this way and also in that, so that if anything is of necessity, it will not be 'both so and not so'.</p>
<p>And, in general, if only the sensible exists, there would be nothing if animate things were not; for there would be no faculty of sense.
Now the view that neither the sensible qualities nor the sensations would exist is doubtless true (for they are affections of the perceiver), but that the substrata which cause the sensation should not exist even apart from sensation is impossible.
For sensation is surely not the sensation of itself, but there is something beyond the sensation, which must be prior to the sensation; for that which moves is prior in nature to that which is moved, and if they are correlative terms, this is no less the case.</p>
